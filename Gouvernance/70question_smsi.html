<p>Some people may wonder why there are so many cyberincidents that take place. After all, in theory, everyone could follow a blueprint and design network security to be bulletproof. Unfortunately, there is no single method to make network security invincible—and there likely never will be. In fact, there is no pathway of actions that can be taken, money spent or technologies utilized that can remove all risk associated with cybersecurity. Sources and degrees of risk are constantly changing along with the threat landscape, and threat actors continue to deploy new techniques and utilize newly discovered vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>Cybersecurity Entropy</h2>
<p>The cyberworld is akin to the concept of entropy<a href="#1" id="f1"><sup>1</sup></a>  in physics. Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. The higher the entropy, the more disorganized the system becomes. Generally, with entropy, all things become less organized with time. This is certainly true when securing networks. Threat actors generally become more organized with time and there is a need to reduce risk just to keep pace.</p>
<p>Virtually every network experiences security entropy. Even if an enterprise has done everything possible to reduce risk, with time, more vulnerabilities (and resulting risk) are exposed. Data try to escape and things that have been stable become unstable—in other words, they experience entropy. Systems and security measures become less organized and more chaotic and are subjected to more entropy. </p>
<h5>Even if an enterprise has done everything possible to reduce risk, with time, more vulnerabilities (and resulting risk) are exposed.</h5>
<h2>70 Layers of Defense </h2>
<p>There are 70 questions that can be asked to determine whether an enterprise has most defensive principles covered and has taken steps to reduce risk (and entropy) associated with cybersecurity. </p>
<p>If you can answer “Yes” to the following 70 questions, then you have significantly reduced your cybersecurity risk. Even so, risk still exists, and entropy must be continuously monitored and mitigated. There is no specific number of layers that can remove all risk, just as there is nothing in the physical universe that does not experience entropy.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, did you find entropy? Did you find additional layers of protection that could be included with a defense in depth (DiD)<a href="#5" id="f5"><sup>5</sup></a>  cybersecurity strategy? Remember, your answers to these questions reflect merely a single point in time. Things change with time—entropy occurs. Technologies change, strategies change, and threat actors continue to make progress and hone their skills. <br>
  It is also worth remembering that while each of the items on the list reduces risk, even if you can confidently answer affirmatively to all 70, you have not eliminated all risk. If there are items that have not been addressed, they are likely worth adding to your cybersecurity road map as soon as possible.</p>
